		<h3>eCommerce Sites</h3>
		<span>$60 / hour</span>
		<p class="tagline">Want to take the next step and sell your products online? Look no further.</p>
		<p>We make eCommerce sites using <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/" target="_blank">Magento</a>. It provides enterprise level security and stability while also offering a huge library of pre-made extensions to the built in functionality. Accept payments in any currency or from any major credit card provider, get live shipping quotes, offer gift cards, send a newsletter or anything else you can find in the <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/" target="_blank">Magento Marketplace</a>.</p>

		<p class="tagline">Can't find what you want for your eCommerce site in the <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/magento-connect/" target="_blank">Magento Marketplace</a>? We'll build it for you.</p>
		<p>Sometimes the functionality you want just isn't available pre-made. If that's the case don't worry, we can help. If it is possible to do we'll find a way to make it happen. We've come to love Magento as a development platform. Just tell us what you need and we'll get it done.</p>

		<h3>Web Applications</h3>
		<span>$80 / hour</span>
		<p class="tagline">Do you have an idea for the next great social media network but don't know how to build it? We know how.</p>
		<p>Web based applications are without a doubt the best way to get your design to a wide audience, and newer browsers allow almost anything to be done on the web. Did you design a game for your Windows desktop computer? Imagine if it ran not only on Windows, but on Mac and Linux and mobile phones too. That is the power of browser based applications, and we can make it happen for you.</p>
